## Dataset
The [FIDAC dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/fidac-forged-images-detection-and-classification) is available on IEEE Dataport and contains original camera-clicked images along with their tampered versions. The dataset was used to train and test our proposed CNN model and compare it with other pre-defined models on various datasets combinations.
